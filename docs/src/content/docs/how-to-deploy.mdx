title: How to Deploy Nara
slug: running-nara/how-to-deploy
---

## docker (recommended)

the easiest way to run nara is with docker:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/eljojo/nara:latest
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/eljojo/nara:latest
```

that's it! visit `http://localhost:8080` to see your nara's web UI, where you can inspect its status, see who it's talking to, and watch events flow through the network.

the console will print useful info as your nara boots up, discovers peers, and starts gossiping. you'll see your nara's generated name, soul, and personality.

### docker-compose

for a more permanent setup:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  nara:
    image: ghcr.io/eljojo/nara:latest
    pull_policy: always
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      # uncomment and set these to preserve identity across restarts:
      # NARA_NAME: "my-nara"
      # NARA_SOUL: "your-soul-string-here"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

on first run, leave `NARA_NAME` and `NARA_SOUL` commented out. check the logs to see what soul was generated, then copy it to your config to preserve your nara's identity.

### memory-aware auto-configuration

nara automatically adjusts its memory usage based on what's available. a **256MB container is enough** to run a fully functional nara—it will just keep fewer events in memory and be more selective about what it gossips.

you can run a free nara instance on [northflank.com](https://northflank.com) with their 256MB containers. the app detects available memory and configures itself accordingly:

- **256MB**: minimal mode, keeps essential events only
- **512MB**: normal mode, good balance
- **1GB+**: hog mode, keeps everything

---

## nixos

for nixos users, nara provides a flake with a ready-to-use module.

### add the flake input

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    nara = {
      url = "github:eljojo/nara";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };
  };

  outputs = { nixpkgs, nara, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations.myhost = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      modules = [
        nara.nixosModules.nara
        # ... your other modules
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

### configure your nara

```nix
{
  services.nara = {
    enable = true;
    instances = {
      rupert = {
        # soul = "abcdef...";
        # ^ first deploy with this commented out to see what soul it generates
        # ^ then run: journalctl -fu nara-rupert
        # ^ copy the soul from the logs and paste it here to preserve identity
      };
    };
  };

  # optional: use the binary cache for faster builds
  nix.settings.extra-substituters = [
    "https://nara.cachix.org"
  ];
  nix.settings.extra-trusted-public-keys = [
    "nara.cachix.org-1:6zWFUhphg54flJs6+htyYuhvdjkByWT2Hi6tZBpVNuE="
  ];
}
```

you can run multiple nara instances on the same machine by adding more entries to `instances`.

### managing the service

each nara instance runs as a systemd service named `nara-<instance-name>`:

```bash
# check status
systemctl status nara-rupert

# view logs
journalctl -fu nara-rupert

# restart
systemctl restart nara-rupert

# stop
systemctl stop nara-rupert
```

### without flakes

if you're not using flakes, you can use flake-compat:

```nix
# configuration.nix
let
  naraCommit = "main"; # or pin to a specific commit
  naraSrc = builtins.fetchTarball {
    url = "https://github.com/eljojo/nara/archive/${naraCommit}.tar.gz";
    # sha256 = "..."; # add hash for reproducibility
  };

  flakeCompatSrc = builtins.fetchTarball {
    url = "https://github.com/NixOS/flake-compat/archive/236f248441a986331cda53b039e7f9fd96e03635.tar.gz";
    sha256 = "sha256-Eyg78VjLzKNG2XkqLqylSvHGAwsP8gsvmUHtZxQwPq4=";
  };

  nara = (import flakeCompatSrc { src = naraSrc; }).defaultNix;
in {
  imports = [
    nara.nixosModules.nara
  ];

  services.nara = {
    enable = true;
    instances = {
      rupert = {
        # soul = "abcdef...";
      };
    };
  };

  # optional: binary cache
  nix.settings.extra-substituters = [ "https://nara.cachix.org" ];
  nix.settings.extra-trusted-public-keys = [
    "nara.cachix.org-1:6zWFUhphg54flJs6+htyYuhvdjkByWT2Hi6tZBpVNuE="
  ];
}
```
