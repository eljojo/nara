# nara

nara is an exploration on decentralized systems: it's an experimental network, a project without clear purpose, and a creative escape.

you can [see it live](https://nara.network) ([backup/debug site](https://global-nara.eljojo.net))

### what's a nara?

a nara is a single entity, it's stateful but it has no persistence. sometimes I think of it as a tamagotchi.

events are shared over [mqtt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT) and nara observe them to form opinions. for example, by observing the network, nara can (independently) group in neighbourhoods based on their "vibes".

each nara has its own **personality** (Agreeableness, Sociability, and Chill), which dictates how it interacts with others and the trends it follows.

### Identity and the Soul

every nara has a **soul** - a portable cryptographic identity that bonds a nara to its name. souls are deterministically generated from hardware fingerprints, but can be saved and moved between machines.

#### Soul Basics

- **Quirky Names**: if a nara is unnamed or has a generic hostname (like `raspberrypi`), it generates a fun, deterministic name like `stretchy-mushroom-421` or `cyber-star-099`. there are over 2.5 million possible name combinations!
- **The Soul**: a 54-character string (Base58 encoded) that cryptographically bonds to a name. on boot, every nara reveals its soul (e.g., `🔮 Soul: 5Kd3...x9Qm`).
- **The Gemstone**: a valid bond between soul and name is shown as a **Gemstone** (💎, 🧿, 🏮). this proves the soul was minted for this name.
- **The Shadow**: if a soul doesn't match its claimed name (a broken bond), it shows a shadow icon (👤) instead.

#### Portability: Travelers and Natives

souls are **portable**. you can move a nara's identity to different hardware:

```bash
# on machine A - note the soul
./nara -name jojo
# logs: 🔮 Soul: 5Kd3NBqT...

# on machine B - pass the soul to preserve identity
./nara -name jojo -soul 5Kd3NBqT...
# logs: ℹ️ Traveler: foreign soul (valid)
```

the soul remains **valid** on machine B because the cryptographic bond (soul ↔ name) is intact. it's just not **native** to that hardware.

| Scenario | Bond | Native | Status |
|----------|------|--------|--------|
| `./nara -name jojo` on HW1 | ✓ valid | ✓ native | 💎 |
| `./nara -name jojo -soul <HW1's soul>` on HW2 | ✓ valid | ✗ foreign | 💎 Traveler |
| `./nara -name jojo -soul <random>` | ✗ invalid | ✗ foreign | 👤 Warning |

#### Saving Your Soul

**important**: if you care about preserving a nara's identity, **save the soul string**.

souls are generated deterministically from hardware fingerprints (MAC addresses, host ID). if your hardware changes (new NIC, VM migration, docker rebuild), your nara will generate a *different* native soul and thus a different identity.

to preserve identity across hardware changes:

1. note the soul on first boot: `🔮 Soul: 5Kd3NBqT...`
2. save it somewhere (env var, secrets manager, config file)
3. pass it on subsequent boots: `-soul 5Kd3NBqT...` or `NARA_SOUL=5Kd3NBqT...`

for docker deployments, consider storing the soul in a volume or external config:

```yaml
environment:
  - NARA_SOUL=${SAVED_SOUL}  # from your secrets
```

#### How It Works (Technical)

a soul is 40 bytes encoded as Base58 (~54 chars):
- **seed** (32 bytes): derived via HKDF from hardware fingerprint
- **tag** (8 bytes): HMAC proving the bond to a specific name

```
tag = HMAC-SHA256(key=seed, msg="nara:name:v1:" + name)[:8]
soul = Base58(seed || tag)
```

validation is simple: recompute the tag from (seed, name) and check it matches.

#### The Flow of the Soul

```mermaid
graph TD
    Boot(Boot Sequence) --> CheckName{Is Name Generic?}
    CheckName -- Yes --> GenSeed[Generate Seed from Hardware]
    GenSeed --> GenName[Derive Name from Seed]
    GenName --> ComputeTag[Compute Bond Tag]
    ComputeTag --> Harmony(💎 Native Soul)

    CheckName -- No --> CheckSoul{Soul Provided?}
    CheckSoul -- No --> CustomSeed[Generate Seed from<br/>Hardware + Name]
    CustomSeed --> ComputeTag

    CheckSoul -- Yes --> ParseSoul[Parse Soul → seed, tag]
    ParseSoul --> ValidateBond{tag == HMAC(seed, name)?}
    ValidateBond -- No --> Shadow(👤 Invalid Bond<br/>Warning!)
    ValidateBond -- Yes --> CheckNative{Is Native Soul?}
    CheckNative -- Yes --> Harmony
    CheckNative -- No --> Traveler(💎 Valid Foreign Soul<br/>Traveler)
```

### Consensus: How Naras Form Opinions

naras observe each other and form opinions about the network. but what happens when naras disagree? for example, two naras might report slightly different start times for a third nara due to clock drift. or a newly-joined nara might have stale information.

#### Uptime-Weighted Clustering

naras use a **credibility-weighted clustering** algorithm with a hierarchy of strategies:

1. **Collect observations** from all neighbors, weighted by their uptime
2. **Cluster similar values** within a 60-second tolerance (handles clock drift)
3. **Pick the winner** using strategies from strictest to most permissive:
   - **Strong**: cluster with >= 2 agreeing observers (agreement beats raw uptime)
   - **Weak**: cluster with highest total uptime (when no agreement exists)
   - **Coin flip**: if top 2 clusters are within 20% uptime, flip a coin 🪙
4. **Return the median** of the winning cluster

```
Example: determining lily's start time

raccoon (uptime: 6 days)  says: 1622957339
lisa    (uptime: 4 hours) says: 1622957340  ← 1 second off (clock drift)
bart    (uptime: 5 hours) says: 1622957339
r2d2    (uptime: 15 days) says: 1622957339

All values within 60s → one cluster
Total uptime: ~21 days
Result: median = 1622957339
```

#### Why Uptime Matters

longer-running naras have had more time to:
- observe the network and converge on truth
- receive corrections from other naras
- form stable opinions

a nara that's been online for 15 days is more trustworthy than one that just booted 5 minutes ago. uptime serves as a credibility weight: evidence from longer-running observers counts more.

#### Edge Cases

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| All naras agree exactly | Returns the agreed value |
| Small disagreement (clock drift) | Clusters together, returns median |
| Two competing clusters (both with 2+ observers) | Cluster with higher total uptime wins |
| One trusted elder vs 2+ agreeing observers | Agreement wins (Strategy 1 > Strategy 2) |
| Two single-observer clusters with similar uptime | 🪙 Coin flip! |
| Complete chaos (all disagree) | Highest uptime wins, or coin flip if close |

### Fashion and Trends

nara love to follow trends! they might start a new trend or join one started by their neighbors. 
- **Following the Wave**: a nara's personality determines how likely it is to join a trend or how quickly it might get bored and leave.
- **Visualizing Fashion**: on the web dashboard, you can see current trends listed. each trend is color-coded, making it easy to spot which naras are currently vibing together.

### Usage

- `--name`: The name for your nara. If generic or missing, a quirky name is generated from the soul.
- `--soul`: Provide a soul string to inherit an existing identity (Base58, ~54 chars).
- `--read-only`: Connect to the network but do not send any messages.
- `--serve-ui`: Serve the web UI at `/`.

#### Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  nara:
    image: ghcr.io/eljojo/nara:latest
    restart: always
    environment:
      - NARA_ID=my-nara-instance
      - NARA_SOUL=  # optional: pass a saved soul to preserve identity
      - MQTT_HOST=tcp://your-mqtt-broker:1883
      - MQTT_USER=your_user
      - MQTT_PASS=your_password
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    command: ["-serve-ui"]
```

for fleets of containers with auto-generated names (no `NARA_ID`), each container gets a unique identity based on its MAC address. if you redeploy and want to keep the same identity, save and restore `NARA_SOUL`.

### NixOS Module

You can also use the provided NixOS module by adding it to your `imports`:

```nix
services.nara = {
  enable = true;
  mqttHost = "tcp://your-mqtt-broker:1883";
  instances = {
    lily = { };                          # generates soul from hardware
    rose = { soul = "5Kd3NBqT..."; };    # uses saved soul
  };
};
```

Each instance can have its own `soul` and `extraArgs`. Check `nara.nix` for more options.
