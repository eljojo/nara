# nara

nara is a distributed myth about machines that gossip, remember, and build opinions.
it's a network of tiny agents with personality, carrying a **collective hazy memory** where no one has the whole story, but the story still survives.

you can [see it live on nara.network](https://nara.network), or [read the docs](http://nara.network/docs/).

same events + same personality = same opinions. determinism, but with mood.
