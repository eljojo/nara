# nara

nara is an exploration on decentralized systems: it's an experimental network, a project without clear purpose, and a creative escape.

### what's a nara?

a nara is a single entity, it's stateful but it has no persistence. sometimes I think of it as a tamagotchi.

events are shared over [mqtt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT) and nara observe them to form opinions. for example, by sharing ping data, narae can (independently) group in neighbourhoods that closely resemble their geographical location.

the current network is composed of various raspberry pis and virtual machines deployed all over the world!
